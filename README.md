# Hearbeat-Classification-LSTM
Classifying heart beat audio files using RNN and LSTM to identify anomalies.
This project is based on a kaggle challenge [https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds] that was based off of the Classifying Heart Sounds Challenge [http://www.peterjbentley.com/heartchallenge/]

My team and I picked this topic to be one of the projects in our Machine Learning course. Have a look at the [jupyter notebook](Heart%20sounds%20analysis%20and%20classification%20with%20LSTM-AugmentAll.ipynb) for details on the entire process

## Topics Covered

1) RNN + LSTM
2) Augmentation
3) Data Cleaning
4) Audio file manipulation
